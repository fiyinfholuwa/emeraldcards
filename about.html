                                    Emerald Gift Card - A prepaid multi-store Verve/Visa/Mastercard branded card,
                                    A prepaid gift card that lets consumers buy; what they want, where they want, without carrying cash. Emerald gift cards provide a way to tap into the financial mainstream, serving as an alternative to cash-based transactions. It offers a more convenient alternative to paper gift vouchers; it is safer than cash, and more flexible than single store cards. It comes in a form of a reloadable card that is not linked to an individual’s bank account.
                                    So what’s behind this phenomenon? No surprises here, consumers want the simplicity and convenience that gift cards provide. Gift givers want to stop guessing and give a gift that everyone can appreciate and very importantly unbanked consumers want the benefits of a card.

                        <div class="text">
                            Emerald Office Expense Card is a prepaid Naira denominated card for corporate organizations issued in partnership with Verve Nigeria. It is linked to a virtual account, with all card transactions directed online real-time to this virtual account.
                            The Emerald Office Expense Cards provides a faster and safer way for company administrative staff to pay for office expenses such as stationeries, groceries, cleaning supplies and other petty cash needs. This is very suitable to organizations that currently handle a lot of petty cash in various departments within the organisation. Each team/department can now have a set amount put on their office expense card for them to use when the needs arises.  This way your staff will not be saddled with the administrative issue of mishandling of cash or irregularities of expense claims from other colleagues. 
                            By using the Emerald Office Expense Card, your admin staff will not need to handle cash. The prefunded Emerald Office Expense Card will be used for payment at the various stores and the receipt issued at the store will simply be submitted to management for reconciliation. Even if the receipt is missing or lost you will be able to track all the transaction done on the card from the monthly statement you’ll receive from us.  Organizations will, no doubt have greater control of their office expenses by effectively managing costs associated with office purchases.

                        <div class="text">
                            Gift cards are a cornerstone of most corporate incentives and reward programs. Many organizations incentivise their staff when they have a special occasion or when they have performed exceptionally well e.g. Employee of the Month/ Year, Sales Person of the Month, etc. Your organisation can now present an incentive that staff will really appreciate because of the choice it gives them to actually purchase their own gift. When staff members are given gifts they already have or gifts they don’t really need, they are not really motivated to perform better next time. 
                            It is also almost impossible for a manager or the HR personnel in charge of incentives to really know the sort of gift a particular staff will appreciate, therefore this saves your management the time it takes to plan on the right type of incentive to get that high performing employee.  Organizations can now give an individual or even a team or department an incentive they will really appreciate because they have the ‘choice’ to determine what they want to buy for themselves.

                            Gift cards are also a cornerstone for client/customer appreciation programs.
